		<h1>This will be your heading</h1>
		<p>Then, you start talking about some interesting stuff that nobody wants to read</p>
		<p>Then you can quote someone to add credibility:</p>

		<blockquote>
			A quotation is handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble of thinking for oneself, always a laborious business. <br />
			<br />
			- A.A. Milne, If I May
		</blockquote>

		<p>Finally you can have some bullets to summarize everything, after all, new generations have this things in common:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Don't like to read long texts.</li>
			<li>Have the spawn of attention of a bird.</li>
			<li>Skip long paragraphs straight to the bullet points.</li>
		</ol>
	</body>
